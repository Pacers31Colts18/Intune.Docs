## Settings
### Accounts Enable Guest Account Status

**Description:** This security setting determines if the Guest account is enabled or disabled.  Default: Disabled.  Note: If the Guest account is disabled and the security option Network Access: Sharing and Security Model for local accounts is set to Guest Only, network logons, such as those performed by the Microsoft Network Server (SMB Service), will fail.

### Accounts Limit Local Account Use Of Blank Passwords To Console Logon Only

**Description:** Accounts: Limit local account use of blank passwords to console logon only  This security setting determines whether local accounts that are not password protected can be used to log on from locations other than the physical computer console. If enabled, local accounts that are not password protected will only be able to log on at the computer's keyboard.  Default: Enabled.   Warning:  Computers that are not in physically secure locations should always enforce strong password policies for all local user accounts. Otherwise, anyone with physical access to the computer can log on by using a user account that does not have a password. This is especially important for portable computers. If you apply this security policy to the Everyone group, no one will be able to log on through Remote Desktop Services.  Notes  This setting does not affect logons that use domain accounts. It is possible for applications that use remote interactive logons to bypass this setting.

### Accounts Rename Administrator Account

**Description:** Accounts: Rename administrator account  This security setting determines whether a different account name is associated with the security identifier (SID) for the account Administrator. Renaming the well-known Administrator account makes it slightly more difficult for unauthorized persons to guess this privileged user name and password combination.  Default: Administrator.

### Accounts Rename Guest Account

**Description:** Accounts: Rename guest account  This security setting determines whether a different account name is associated with the security identifier (SID) for the account "Guest." Renaming the well-known Guest account makes it slightly more difficult for unauthorized persons to guess this user name and password combination.  Default: Guest.

### Interactive Logon Do Not Display Last Signed In

**Description:** Interactive logon: Don't display last signed-in This security setting determines whether the Windows sign-in screen will show the username of the last person who signed in on this PC. If this policy is enabled, the username will not be shown.  If this policy is disabled, the username will be shown.  Default: Disabled.

}
```

### Interactive Logon Do Not Require CTRLALTDEL

**Description:** Interactive logon: Do not require CTRL+ALT+DEL  This security setting determines whether pressing CTRL+ALT+DEL is required before a user can log on.  If this policy is enabled on a computer, a user is not required to press CTRL+ALT+DEL to log on. Not having to press CTRL+ALT+DEL leaves users susceptible to attacks that attempt to intercept the users' passwords. Requiring CTRL+ALT+DEL before users log on ensures that users are communicating by means of a trusted path when entering their passwords.  If this policy is disabled, any user is required to press CTRL+ALT+DEL before logging on to Windows.  Default on domain-computers: Enabled: At least Windows  8/Disabled: Windows 7 or earlier. Default on stand-alone computers: Enabled.

### Interactive Logon Machine Inactivity Limit

**Description:** Interactive logon: Machine inactivity limit.  Windows notices inactivity of a logon session, and if the amount of inactive time exceeds the inactivity limit, then the screen saver will run, locking the session.  Default: not enforced.

**URI:** ./Device/Vendor/MSFT/Policy/Config/LocalPoliciesSecurityOptions/InteractiveLogon_MachineInactivityLimit

```

### Interactive Logon Smart Card Removal Behavior

**Description:** Interactive logon: Smart card removal behavior  This security setting determines what happens when the smart card for a logged-on user is removed from the smart card reader.  The options are:   No Action  Lock Workstation  Force Logoff  Disconnect if a Remote Desktop Services session   If you click Lock Workstation in the Properties dialog box for this policy, the workstation is locked when the smart card is removed, allowing users to leave the area, take their smart card with them, and still maintain a protected session.  If you click Force Logoff in the Properties dialog box for this policy, the user is automatically logged off when the smart card is removed.  If you click Disconnect if a Remote Desktop Services session, removal of the smart card disconnects the session without logging the user off. This allows the user to insert the smart card and resume the session later, or at another smart card reader-equipped computer, without having to log on again. If the session is local, this policy functions identically to Lock Workstation.  Note: Remote Desktop Services was called Terminal Services in previous versions of Windows Server.  Default: This policy is not defined, which means that the system treats it as No action.  On Windows Vista and above: For this setting to work, the Smart Card Removal Policy service must be started.

### Microsoft Network Client Digitally Sign Communications Always

**Description:** Microsoft network client: Digitally sign communications (always)  This security setting determines whether packet signing is required by the SMB client component.  The server message block (SMB) protocol provides the basis for Microsoft file and print sharing and many other networking operations, such as remote Windows administration. To prevent man-in-the-middle attacks that modify SMB packets in transit, the SMB protocol supports the digital signing of SMB packets. This policy setting determines whether SMB packet signing must be negotiated before further communication with an SMB server is permitted.  If this setting is enabled, the Microsoft network client will not communicate with a Microsoft network server unless that server agrees to perform SMB packet signing. If this policy is disabled, SMB packet signing is negotiated between the client and server.  Default: Disabled.  Important  For this policy to take effect on computers running Windows 2000, client-side packet signing must also be enabled. To enable client-side SMB packet signing, set Microsoft network client: Digitally sign communications (if server agrees).  Notes  All Windows operating systems support both a client-side SMB component and a server-side SMB component. On Windows 2000 and later operating systems, enabling or requiring packet signing for client and server-side SMB components is controlled by the following four policy settings: Microsoft network client: Digitally sign communications (always) - Controls whether or not the client-side SMB component requires packet signing. Microsoft network client: Digitally sign communications (if server agrees) - Controls whether or not the client-side SMB component has packet signing enabled. Microsoft network server: Digitally sign communications (always) - Controls whether or not the server-side SMB component requires packet signing. Microsoft network server: Digitally sign communications (if client agrees) - Controls whether or not the server-side SMB component has packet signing enabled. SMB packet signing can significantly degrade SMB performance, depending on dialect version, OS version, file sizes, processor offloading capabilities, and application IO behaviors.

### Microsoft Network Client Digitally Sign Communications If Server Agrees

**Description:** Microsoft network client: Digitally sign communications (if server agrees)  This security setting determines whether the SMB client attempts to negotiate SMB packet signing.  The server message block (SMB) protocol provides the basis for Microsoft file and print sharing and many other networking operations, such as remote Windows administration. To prevent man-in-the-middle attacks that modify SMB packets in transit, the SMB protocol supports the digital signing of SMB packets. This policy setting determines whether the SMB client component attempts to negotiate SMB packet signing when it connects to an SMB server.  If this setting is enabled, the Microsoft network client will ask the server to perform SMB packet signing upon session setup. If packet signing has been enabled on the server, packet signing will be negotiated. If this policy is disabled, the SMB client will never negotiate SMB packet signing.  Default: Enabled.  Notes  All Windows operating systems support both a client-side SMB component and a server-side SMB component. On Windows 2000 and later, enabling or requiring packet signing for client and server-side SMB components is controlled by the following four policy settings: Microsoft network client: Digitally sign communications (always) - Controls whether or not the client-side SMB component requires packet signing. Microsoft network client: Digitally sign communications (if server agrees) - Controls whether or not the client-side SMB component has packet signing enabled. Microsoft network server: Digitally sign communications (always) - Controls whether or not the server-side SMB component requires packet signing. Microsoft network server: Digitally sign communications (if client agrees) - Controls whether or not the server-side SMB component has packet signing enabled. If both client-side and server-side SMB signing is enabled and the client establishes an SMB 1.0 connection to the server, SMB signing will be attempted. SMB packet signing can significantly degrade SMB performance, depending on dialect version, OS version, file sizes, processor offloading capabilities, and application IO behaviors. This setting only applies to SMB 1.0 connections. For more information, reference: https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=787136.

### Microsoft Network Client Send Unencrypted Password To Third Party SMB Servers

**Description:** Microsoft network client: Send unencrypted password to connect to third-party SMB servers  If this security setting is enabled, the Server Message Block (SMB) redirector is allowed to send plaintext passwords to non-Microsoft SMB servers that do not support password encryption during authentication.  Sending unencrypted passwords is a security risk.  Default: Disabled.

### Microsoft Network Server Digitally Sign Communications Always

**Description:** Microsoft network server: Digitally sign communications (always)  This security setting determines whether packet signing is required by the SMB server component.  The server message block (SMB) protocol provides the basis for Microsoft file and print sharing and many other networking operations, such as remote Windows administration. To prevent man-in-the-middle attacks that modify SMB packets in transit, the SMB protocol supports the digital signing of SMB packets. This policy setting determines whether SMB packet signing must be negotiated before further communication with an SMB client is permitted.  If this setting is enabled, the Microsoft network server will not communicate with a Microsoft network client unless that client agrees to perform SMB packet signing. If this setting is disabled, SMB packet signing is negotiated between the client and server.  Default:  Disabled for member servers. Enabled for domain controllers.  Notes  All Windows operating systems support both a client-side SMB component and a server-side SMB component. On Windows 2000 and later, enabling or requiring packet signing for client and server-side SMB components is controlled by the following four policy settings: Microsoft network client: Digitally sign communications (always) - Controls whether or not the client-side SMB component requires packet signing. Microsoft network client: Digitally sign communications (if server agrees) - Controls whether or not the client-side SMB component has packet signing enabled. Microsoft network server: Digitally sign communications (always) - Controls whether or not the server-side SMB component requires packet signing. Microsoft network server: Digitally sign communications (if client agrees) - Controls whether or not the server-side SMB component has packet signing enabled. Similarly, if client-side SMB signing is required, that client will not be able to establish a session with servers that do not have packet signing enabled. By default, server-side SMB signing is enabled only on domain controllers. If server-side SMB signing is enabled, SMB packet signing will be negotiated with clients that have client-side SMB signing enabled. SMB packet signing can significantly degrade SMB performance, depending on dialect version, OS version, file sizes, processor offloading capabilities, and application IO behaviors.  Important  For this policy to take effect on computers running Windows 2000, server-side packet signing must also be enabled. To enable server-side SMB packet signing, set the following policy: Microsoft network server: Digitally sign communications (if server agrees)  For Windows 2000 servers to negotiate signing with Windows NT 4.0 clients, the following registry value must be set to 1 on the Windows 2000 server: HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\lanmanserver\parameters\enableW9xsecuritysignature For more information, reference: https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=787136.

### Microsoft Network Server Digitally Sign Communications If Client Agrees

**Description:** Microsoft network server: Digitally sign communications (if client agrees)  This security setting determines whether the SMB server will negotiate SMB packet signing with clients that request it.  The server message block (SMB) protocol provides the basis for Microsoft file and print sharing and many other networking operations, such as remote Windows administration. To prevent man-in-the-middle attacks that modify SMB packets in transit, the SMB protocol supports the digital signing of SMB packets. This policy setting determines whether the SMB server will negotiate SMB packet signing when an SMB client requests it.  If this setting is enabled, the Microsoft network server will negotiate SMB packet signing as requested by the client. That is, if packet signing has been enabled on the client, packet signing will be negotiated. If this policy is disabled, the SMB client will never negotiate SMB packet signing.  Default: Enabled on domain controllers only.  Important  For Windows 2000 servers to negotiate signing with Windows NT 4.0 clients, the following registry value must be set to 1 on the server running Windows 2000: HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\lanmanserver\parameters\enableW9xsecuritysignature  Notes  All Windows operating systems support both a client-side SMB component and a server-side SMB component. For Windows 2000 and above, enabling or requiring packet signing for client and server-side SMB components is controlled by the following four policy settings: Microsoft network client: Digitally sign communications (always) - Controls whether or not the client-side SMB component requires packet signing. Microsoft network client: Digitally sign communications (if server agrees) - Controls whether or not the client-side SMB component has packet signing enabled.

### Network Access Do Not Allow Anonymous Enumeration Of SAM Accounts

**Description:** Network access: Do not allow anonymous enumeration of SAM accounts  This security setting determines what additional permissions will be granted for anonymous connections to the computer.  Windows allows anonymous users to perform certain activities, such as enumerating the names of domain accounts and network shares. This is convenient, for example, when an administrator wants to grant access to users in a trusted domain that does not maintain a reciprocal trust.  This security option allows additional restrictions to be placed on anonymous connections as follows:  Enabled: Do not allow enumeration of SAM accounts. This option replaces Everyone with Authenticated Users in the security permissions for resources. Disabled: No additional restrictions. Rely on default permissions.  Default on workstations: Enabled. Default on server:Enabled.  Important  This policy has no impact on domain controllers.

### Network Security Allow Local System To Use Computer Identity For NTLM

**Description:** Network security: Allow Local System to use computer identity for NTLM  This policy setting allows Local System services that use Negotiate to use the computer identity when reverting to NTLM authentication.  If you enable this policy setting, services running as Local System that use Negotiate will use the computer identity. This might cause some authentication requests between Windows operating systems to fail and log an error.  If you disable this policy setting, services running as Local System that use Negotiate when reverting to NTLM authentication will authenticate anonymously.  By default, this policy is enabled on Windows 7 and above.  By default, this policy is disabled on Windows Vista.  This policy is supported on at least Windows Vista or Windows Server 2008.  Note: Windows Vista or Windows Server 2008 do not expose this setting in Group Policy.

### Network Security Do Not Store LAN Manager Hash Value On Next Password Change

**Description:** Network security: Do not store LAN Manager hash value on next password change  This security setting determines if, at the next password change, the LAN Manager (LM) hash value for the new password is stored. The LM hash is relatively weak and prone to attack, as compared with the cryptographically stronger Windows NT hash. Since the LM hash is stored on the local computer in the security database the passwords can be compromised if the security database is attacked.   Default on Windows Vista and above: Enabled Default on Windows XP: Disabled.  Important  Windows 2000 Service Pack 2 (SP2) and above offer compatibility with authentication to previous versions of Windows, such as Microsoft Windows NT 4.0. This setting can affect the ability of computers running Windows 2000 Server, Windows 2000 Professional, Windows XP, and the Windows Server 2003 family to communicate with computers running Windows 95 and Windows 98.

### Network Security LAN Manager Authentication Level

**Description:** Network security LAN Manager authentication level  This security setting determines which challenge/response authentication protocol is used for network logons. This choice affects the level of authentication protocol used by clients, the level of session security negotiated, and the level of authentication accepted by servers as follows:  Send LM and NTLM responses: Clients use LM and NTLM authentication and never use NTLMv2 session security; domain controllers accept LM, NTLM, and NTLMv2 authentication.  Send LM and NTLM - use NTLMv2 session security if negotiated: Clients use LM and NTLM authentication and use NTLMv2 session security if the server supports it; domain controllers accept LM, NTLM, and NTLMv2 authentication.  Send NTLM response only: Clients use NTLM authentication only and use NTLMv2 session security if the server supports it; domain controllers accept LM, NTLM, and NTLMv2 authentication.  Send NTLMv2 response only: Clients use NTLMv2 authentication only and use NTLMv2 session security if the server supports it; domain controllers accept LM, NTLM, and NTLMv2 authentication.  Send NTLMv2 response only\refuse LM: Clients use NTLMv2 authentication only and use NTLMv2 session security if the server supports it; domain controllers refuse LM (accept only NTLM and NTLMv2 authentication).  Send NTLMv2 response only\refuse LM and NTLM: Clients use NTLMv2 authentication only and use NTLMv2 session security if the server supports it; domain controllers refuse LM and NTLM (accept only NTLMv2 authentication).  Important  This setting can affect the ability of computers running Windows 2000 Server, Windows 2000 Professional, Windows XP Professional, and the Windows Server 2003 family to communicate with computers running Windows NT 4.0 and earlier over the network. For example, at the time of this writing, computers running Windows NT 4.0 SP4 and earlier did not support NTLMv2. Computers running Windows 95 and Windows 98 did not support NTLM.  Default:  Windows 2000 and windows XP: send LM and NTLM responses  Windows Server 2003: Send NTLM response only  Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, and Windows Server 2008 R2: Send NTLMv2 response only

If you click Force Logoff in the Properties dialog box for this policy, the user is automatically logged off when the smart card is removed.  If you click Disconnect if a Remote Desktop Services session, removal of the smart card disconnects the session without logging the user off. This allows the user to insert the smart card and resume the session later, or at another smart card reader-equipped computer, without having to log on again. If the session is local, this policy functions identically to Lock Workstation.  Note: Remote Desktop Services was called Terminal Services in previous versions of Windows Server.

This policy setting determines whether SMB packet signing must be negotiated before further communication with an SMB server is permitted.

Notes  All Windows operating systems support both a client-side SMB component and a server-side SMB component. On Windows 2000 and later operating systems, enabling or requiring packet signing for client and server-side SMB components is controlled by the following four policy settings: Microsoft network client: Digitally sign communications (always) - Controls whether or not the client-side SMB component requires packet signing.

    "description": "Microsoft network server: Digitally sign communications (if client agrees)  This security setting determines whether the SMB server will negotiate SMB packet signing with clients that request it.  The server message block (SMB) protocol provides the basis for Microsoft file and print sharing and many other networking operations, such as remote Windows administration. To prevent man-in-the-middle attacks that modify SMB packets in transit, the SMB protocol supports the digital signing of SMB packets. This policy setting determines whether the SMB server will negotiate SMB packet signing when an SMB client requests it.  If this setting is enabled, the Microsoft network server will negotiate SMB packet signing as requested by the client. That is, if packet signing has been enabled on the client, packet signing will be negotiated. If this policy is disabled, the SMB client will never negotiate SMB packet signing.  Default: Enabled on domain controllers only.  Important  For Windows 2000 servers to negotiate signing with Windows NT 4.0 clients, the following registry value must be set to 1 on the server running Windows 2000: HKLM\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\lanmanserver\\parameters\\enableW9xsecuritysignature  Notes  All Windows operating systems support both a client-side SMB component and a server-side SMB component. For Windows 2000 and above, enabling or requiring packet signing for client and server-side SMB components is controlled by the following four policy settings: Microsoft network client: Digitally sign communications (always) - Controls whether or not the client-side SMB component requires packet signing. Microsoft network client: Digitally sign communications (if server agrees) - Controls whether or not the client-side SMB component has packet signing enabled. Microsoft network server: Digitally sign communications (always) - Controls whether or not the server-side SMB component requires packet signing. Microsoft network server: Digitally sign communications (if client agrees) - Controls whether or not the server-side SMB component has packet signing enabled. If both client-side and server-side SMB signing is enabled and the client establishes an SMB 1.0 connection to the server, SMB signing will be attempted. SMB packet signing can significantly degrade SMB performance, depending on dialect version, OS version, file sizes, processor offloading capabilities, and application IO behaviors. This setting only applies to SMB 1.0 connections. For more information, reference: https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=787136.",
