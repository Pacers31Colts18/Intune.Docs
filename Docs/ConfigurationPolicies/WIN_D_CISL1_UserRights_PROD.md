## Settings
### Access Credential Manager As Trusted Caller

**Description:** This user right is used by Credential Manager during Backup/Restore. No accounts should have this privilege, as it is only assigned to Winlogon. Users' saved credentials might be compromised if this privilege is given to other entities.

**URI:** ./Device/Vendor/MSFT/Policy/Config/UserRights/AccessCredentialManagerAsTrustedCaller

**InfoURL:** https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/client-management/mdm/policy-csp-UserRights#accesscredentialmanagerastrustedcaller

  "@odata.type": "#microsoft.graph.deviceManagementConfigurationStringSettingValue",
  "settingValueTemplateReference": null,
  "value": "(<![CDATA[]]>)"
}
```

### Access From Network

**Description:** This user right determines which users and groups are allowed to connect to the computer over the network. Remote Desktop Services are not affected by this user right.Note: Remote Desktop Services was called Terminal Services in previous versions of Windows Server.

**URI:** ./Device/Vendor/MSFT/Policy/Config/UserRights/AccessFromNetwork

  "settingValueTemplateReference": null,
  "value": "*S-1-5-32-555"
}
```

### Act As Part Of The Operating System

**Description:** This user right allows a process to impersonate any user without authentication. The process can therefore gain access to the same local resources as that user. Processes that require this privilege should use the LocalSystem account, which already includes this privilege, rather than using a separate user account with this privilege specially assigned. Caution:Assigning this user right can be a security risk. Only assign this user right to trusted users.

  "value": "*S-1-5-32-544"
}
```

### Change System Time

**Description:** This user right determines which users and groups can change the time and date on the internal clock of the computer. Users that are assigned this user right can affect the appearance of event logs. If the system time is changed, events that are logged will reflect this new time, not the actual time that the events occurred.

  "settingValueTemplateReference": null,
  "value": "*S-1-5-19"
}
```

### Create Global Objects

**Description:** This security setting determines whether users can create global objects that are available to all sessions. Users can still create objects that are specific to their own session if they do not have this user right. Users who can create global objects could affect processes that run under other users' sessions, which could lead to application failure or data corruption. Caution: Assigning this user right can be a security risk. Assign this user right only to trusted users.

  "settingValueTemplateReference": null,
  "value": "*S-1-5-32-544"
}
```

### Create Permanent Shared Objects

**Description:** This user right determines which accounts can be used by processes to create a directory object using the object manager. This user right is used internally by the operating system and is useful to kernel-mode components that extend the object namespace. Because components that are running in kernel mode already have this user right assigned to them, it is not necessary to specifically assign it.

**URI:** ./Device/Vendor/MSFT/Policy/Config/UserRights/CreatePermanentSharedObjects

**InfoURL:** https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/client-management/mdm/policy-csp-UserRights#createpermanentsharedobjects

}
```

### Create Symbolic Links

**Description:** This user right determines if the user can create a symbolic link from the computer he is logged on to. Caution: This privilege should only be given to trusted users. Symbolic links can expose security vulnerabilities in applications that aren't designed to handle them. Note: This setting can be used in conjunction a symlink filesystem setting that can be manipulated with the command line utility to control the kinds of symlinks that are allowed on the machine. Type 'fsutil behavior set symlinkevaluation /?' at the command line to get more information about fsutil and symbolic links.

  "settingValueTemplateReference": null,
  "value": "*S-1-5-32-544"
}
```

### Create Token

**Description:** This user right determines which accounts can be used by processes to create a token that can then be used to get access to any local resources when the process uses an internal application programming interface (API) to create an access token. This user right is used internally by the operating system. Unless it is necessary, do not assign this user right to a user, group, or process other than Local System. Caution: Assigning this user right can be a security risk. Do not assign this user right to any user, group, or process that you do not want to take over the system.

**URI:** ./Device/Vendor/MSFT/Policy/Config/UserRights/CreateToken

{
  "@odata.type": "#microsoft.graph.deviceManagementConfigurationStringSettingValue",
  "settingValueTemplateReference": null,
  "value": "(<![CDATA[]]>)"
}
```

### Debug Programs

**Description:** This user right determines which users can attach a debugger to any process or to the kernel. Developers who are debugging their own applications do not need to be assigned this user right. Developers who are debugging new system components will need this user right to be able to do so. This user right provides complete access to sensitive and critical operating system components. Caution:Assigning this user right can be a security risk. Only assign this user right to trusted users.

}
```

### Enable Delegation

**Description:** This user right determines which users can set the Trusted for Delegation setting on a user or computer object. The user or object that is granted this privilege must have write access to the account control flags on the user or computer object. A server process running on a computer (or under a user context) that is trusted for delegation can access resources on another computer using delegated credentials of a client, as long as the client account does not have the Account cannot be delegated account control flag set. Caution: Misuse of this user right, or of the Trusted for Delegation setting, could make the network vulnerable to sophisticated attacks using Trojan horse programs that impersonate incoming clients and use their credentials to gain access to network resources.

  "settingValueTemplateReference": null,
  "value": "(<![CDATA[]]>)"
}
```

### Generate Security Audits

**Description:** This user right determines which accounts can be used by a process to add entries to the security log. The security log is used to trace unauthorized system access. Misuse of this user right can result in the generation of many auditing events, potentially hiding evidence of an attack or causing a denial of service. Shut down system immediately if unable to log security audits security policy setting is enabled.

  "@odata.type": "#microsoft.graph.deviceManagementConfigurationStringSettingValue",
  "settingValueTemplateReference": null,
  "value": "*S-1-5-20"
}
```

### Impersonate Client

**Description:** Assigning this user right to a user allows programs running on behalf of that user to impersonate a client. Requiring this user right for this kind of impersonation prevents an unauthorized user from convincing a client to connect (for example, by remote procedure call (RPC) or named pipes) to a service that they have created and then impersonating that client, which can elevate the unauthorized user's permissions to administrative or system levels. Caution: Assigning this user right can be a security risk. Only assign this user right to trusted users. Note: By default, services that are started by the Service Control Manager have the built-in Service group added to their access tokens. Component Object Model (COM) servers that are started by the COM infrastructure and that are configured to run under a specific account also have the Service group added to their access tokens. As a result, these services get this user right when they are started. In addition, a user can also impersonate an access token if any of the following conditions exist.  1) The access token that is being impersonated is for this user. 2) The user, in this logon session, created the access token by logging on to the network with explicit credentials. 3) The requested level is less than Impersonate, such as Anonymous or Identify. Because of these factors, users do not usually need this user right. Warning: If you enable this setting, programs that previously had the Impersonate privilege may lose it, and they may not run.

Requiring this user right for this kind of impersonation prevents an unauthorized user from convincing a client to connect (for example, by remote procedure call (RPC) or named pipes) to a service that they have created and then impersonating that client, which can elevate the unauthorized user's permissions to administrative or system levels. Caution: Assigning this user right can be a security risk. Only assign this user right to trusted users. Note: By default, services that are started by the Service Control Manager have the built-in Service group added to their access tokens. Component Object Model (COM) servers that are started by the COM infrastructure and that are configured to run under a specific account also have the Service group added to their access tokens. As a result, these services get this user right when they are started. In addition, a user can also impersonate an access token if any of the following conditions exist.  1) The access token that is being impersonated is for this user. 2) The user, in this logon session, created the access token by logging on to the network with explicit credentials. 3) The requested level is less than Impersonate, such as Anonymous or Identify. Because of these factors, users do not usually need this user right. Warning: If you enable this setting, programs that previously had the Impersonate privilege may lose it, and they may not run.",
