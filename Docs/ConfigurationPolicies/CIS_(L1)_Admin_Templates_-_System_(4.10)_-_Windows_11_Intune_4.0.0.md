## Settings
### Include command line in process creation events

**Description:** This policy setting determines what information is logged in security audit events when a new process has been created.

This setting only applies when the Audit Process Creation policy is enabled. If you enable this policy setting the command line information for every process will be logged in plain text in the security event log as part of the Audit Process Creation event 4688, "a new process has been created," on the workstations and servers on which this policy setting is applied.

If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, the process's command line information will not be included in Audit Process Creation events.

Default: Not configured

Note: When this policy setting is enabled, any user with access to read the security events will be able to read the command line arguments for any successfully created process. Command line arguments can contain sensitive or private information such as passwords or user data.

### Encryption Oracle Remediation

**Description:** Encryption Oracle Remediation

This policy setting applies to applications using the CredSSP component (for example: Remote Desktop Connection).

Some versions of the CredSSP protocol are vulnerable to an encryption oracle attack against the client.  This policy controls compatibility with vulnerable clients and servers.  This policy allows you to set the level of protection desired for the encryption oracle vulnerability.

If you enable this policy setting, CredSSP version support will be selected based on the following options:

Force Updated Clients: Client applications which use CredSSP will not be able to fall back to the insecure versions and services using CredSSP will not accept unpatched clients. Note: this setting should not be deployed until all remote hosts support the newest version.

Mitigated: Client applications which use CredSSP will not be able to fall back to the insecure version but services using CredSSP will accept unpatched clients. See the link below for important information about the risk posed by remaining unpatched clients.

Vulnerable: Client applications which use CredSSP will expose the remote servers to attacks by supporting fall back to the insecure versions and services using CredSSP will accept unpatched clients.

For more information about the vulnerability and servicing requirements for protection, see https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=866660

### Remote host allows delegation of non-exportable credentials

**Description:** Remote host allows delegation of non-exportable credentials

When using credential delegation, devices provide an exportable version of credentials to the remote host. This exposes users to the risk of credential theft from attackers on the remote host.

If you enable this policy setting, the host supports Restricted Admin or Remote Credential Guard mode.

If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, Restricted Administration and Remote Credential Guard mode are not supported. User will always need to pass their credentials to the host.

### Boot-Start Driver Initialization Policy

**Description:** This policy setting allows you to specify which boot-start drivers are initialized based on a classification determined by an Early Launch Antimalware boot-start driver. The Early Launch Antimalware boot-start driver can return the following classifications for each boot-start driver:
-  Good: The driver has been signed and has not been tampered with.
-  Bad: The driver has been identified as malware. It is recommended that you do not allow known bad drivers to be initialized.
-  Bad, but required for boot: The driver has been identified as malware, but the computer cannot successfully boot without loading this driver.
-  Unknown: This driver has not been attested to by your malware detection application and has not been classified by the Early Launch Antimalware boot-start driver.

If you enable this policy setting you will be able to choose which boot-start drivers to initialize the next time the computer is started.

If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, the boot start drivers determined to be Good, Unknown or Bad but Boot Critical are initialized and the initialization of drivers determined to be Bad is skipped.

If your malware detection application does not include an Early Launch Antimalware boot-start driver or if your Early Launch Antimalware boot-start driver has been disabled, this setting has no effect and all boot-start drivers are initialized.

### Enable RPC Endpoint Mapper Client Authentication

**Description:** This policy setting controls whether RPC clients authenticate with the Endpoint Mapper Service when the call they are making contains authentication information.   The Endpoint Mapper Service on computers running Windows NT4 (all service packs) cannot process authentication information supplied in this manner. 

If you disable this policy setting, RPC clients will not authenticate to the Endpoint Mapper Service, but they will be able to communicate with the Endpoint Mapper Service on Windows NT4 Server.

If you enable this policy setting, RPC clients will authenticate to the Endpoint Mapper Service for calls that contain authentication information.  Clients making such calls will not be able to communicate with the Windows NT4 Server Endpoint Mapper Service.

If you do not configure this policy setting, it remains disabled.  RPC clients will not authenticate to the Endpoint Mapper Service, but they will be able to communicate with the Windows NT4 Server Endpoint Mapper Service.

Note: This policy will not be applied until the system is rebooted.

### Restrict Unauthenticated RPC clients

**Description:** This policy setting controls how the RPC server runtime handles unauthenticated RPC clients connecting to RPC servers.

This policy setting impacts all RPC applications.  In a domain environment this policy setting should be used with caution as it can impact a wide range of functionality including group policy processing itself.  Reverting a change to this policy setting can require manual intervention on each affected machine.  This policy setting should never be applied to a domain controller.

If you disable this policy setting, the RPC server runtime uses the value of "Authenticated" on Windows Client, and the value of "None" on Windows Server versions that support this policy setting. 

If you do not configure this policy setting, it remains disabled.  The RPC server runtime will behave as though it was enabled with the value of "Authenticated" used for Windows Client and the value of "None" used for Server SKUs that support this policy setting. 

If you enable this policy setting, it directs the RPC server runtime to restrict unauthenticated RPC clients connecting to RPC servers running on a machine. A client will be considered an authenticated client if it uses a named pipe to communicate with the server or if it uses RPC Security. RPC Interfaces that have specifically requested to be accessible by unauthenticated clients may be exempt from this restriction, depending on the selected value for this policy setting.

--  "None" allows all RPC clients to connect to RPC Servers running on the machine on which the policy setting is applied.

--  "Authenticated" allows only authenticated RPC Clients (per the definition above) to connect to RPC Servers running on the machine on which the policy setting is applied. Exemptions are granted to interfaces that have requested them.

--  "Authenticated without exceptions" allows only authenticated RPC Clients (per the definition above) to connect to RPC Servers running on the machine on which the policy setting is applied.  No exceptions are allowed.

Note: This policy setting will not be applied until the system is rebooted.

### Enable Windows NTP Client

**Description:** This policy setting specifies whether the Windows NTP Client is enabled.

Enabling the Windows NTP Client allows your computer to synchronize its computer clock with other NTP servers. You might want to disable this service if you decide to use a third-party time provider.

If you enable this policy setting, you can set the local computer clock to synchronize time with NTP servers.

If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, the local computer clock does not synchronize time with NTP servers.

A client will be considered an authenticated client if it uses a named pipe to communicate with the server or if it uses RPC Security. RPC Interfaces that have specifically requested to be accessible by unauthenticated clients may be exempt from this restriction, depending on the selected value for this policy setting.\r\n\r\n--  \"None\" allows all RPC clients to connect to RPC Servers running on the machine on which the policy setting is applied.\r\n\r\n--  \"Authenticated\" allows only authenticated RPC Clients (per the definition above) to connect to RPC Servers running on the machine on which the policy setting is applied. Exemptions are granted to interfaces that have requested them.\r\n\r\n--  \"Authenticated without exceptions\" allows only authenticated RPC Clients (per the definition above) to connect to RPC Servers running on the machine on which the policy setting is applied.  No exceptions are allowed.\r\n\r\nNote: This policy setting will not be applied until the system is rebooted.",
