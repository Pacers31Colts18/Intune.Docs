## Settings
### Account Logon Audit Credential Validation

**Description:** This policy setting allows you to audit events generated by validation tests on user account logon credentials.  Events in this subcategory occur only on the computer that is authoritative for those credentials. For domain accounts, the domain controller is authoritative. For local accounts, the local computer is authoritative.

### Account Logon Logoff Audit Account Lockout

**Description:** This policy setting allows you to audit events generated by a failed attempt to log on to an account that is locked out.  If you configure this policy setting, an audit event is generated when an account cannot log on to a computer because the account is locked out. Success audits record successful attempts and Failure audits record unsuccessful attempts.  Logon events are essential for understanding user activity and to detect potential attacks.

### Account Logon Logoff Audit Group Membership

**Description:** This policy allows you to audit the group memberhsip information in the user's logon token. Events in this subcategory are generated on the computer on which a logon session is created. For an interactive logon, the security audit event is generated on the computer that the user logged on to. For a network logon, such as accessing a shared folder on the network, the security audit event is generated on the computer hosting the resource.  When this setting is configured, one or more security audit events are generated for each successful logon. You must also enable the Audit Logon setting under Advanced Audit Policy Configuration\System Audit Policies\Logon/Logoff. Multiple events are generated if the group memberhsip information cannot fit in a single security audit event.

### Account Logon Logoff Audit Logoff

**Description:** This policy setting allows you to audit events generated by the closing of a logon session. These events occur on the computer that was accessed. For an interactive logoff the security audit event is generated on the computer that the user account logged on to.  If you configure this policy setting, an audit event is generated when a logon session is closed. Success audits record successful attempts to close sessions and Failure audits record unsuccessful attempts to close sessions. If you do not configure this policy setting, no audit event is generated when a logon session is closed.

### Account Logon Logoff Audit Logon

**Description:** This policy setting allows you to audit events generated by user account logon attempts on the computer. Events in this subcategory are related to the creation of logon sessions and occur on the computer which was accessed. For an interactive logon, the security audit event is generated on the computer that the user account logged on to. For a network logon, such as accessing a shared folder on the network, the security audit event is generated on the computer hosting the resource. The following events are included:     Successful logon attempts.     Failed logon attempts.     Logon attempts using explicit credentials. This event is generated when a process attempts to log on an account by explicitly specifying that account’s credentials. This most commonly occurs in batch logon configurations, such as scheduled tasks or when using the RUNAS command.     Security identifiers (SIDs) were filtered and not allowed to log on.

### Privilege Use Audit Sensitive Privilege Use

**Description:** This policy setting allows you to audit events generated when sensitive privileges (user rights) are used such as the following:     A privileged service is called.     One of the following privileges are called:         Act as part of the operating system.         Back up files and directories.         Create a token object.         Debug programs.         Enable computer and user accounts to be trusted for delegation.         Generate security audits.         Impersonate a client after authentication.         Load and unload device drivers.         Manage auditing and security log.         Modify firmware environment values.         Replace a process-level token.         Restore files and directories.         Take ownership of files or other objects.  If you configure this policy setting, an audit event is generated when sensitive privilege requests are made. Success audits record successful requests and Failure audits record unsuccessful requests. If you do not configure this policy setting, no audit event is generated when sensitive privilege requests are made.

### System Audit I Psec Driver

**Description:** This policy setting allows you to audit events generated by the IPsec filter driver such as the following:     Startup and shutdown of the IPsec services.     Network packets dropped due to integrity check failure.     Network packets dropped due to replay check failure.     Network packets dropped due to being in plaintext.     Network packets received with incorrect Security Parameter Index (SPI). This may indicate that either the network card is not working correctly or the driver needs to be updated.     Inability to process IPsec filters.  If you configure this policy setting, an audit event is generated on an IPsec filter driver operation. Success audits record successful attempts and Failure audits record unsuccessful attempts. If you do not configure this policy setting, no audit event is generated on an IPSec filter driver operation.

### System Audit System Integrity

**Description:** This policy setting allows you to audit events that violate the integrity of the security subsystem, such as the following:     Events that could not be written to the event log because of a problem with the auditing system.     A process that uses a local procedure call (LPC) port that is not valid in an attempt to impersonate a client by replying, reading, or writing to or from a client address space.     The detection of a Remote Procedure Call (RPC) that compromises system integrity.     The detection of a hash value of an executable file that is not valid as determined by Code Integrity.

For a network logon, such as accessing a shared folder on the network, the security audit event is generated on the computer hosting the resource.

This event is generated when a process attempts to log on an account by explicitly specifying that account’s credentials. This most commonly occurs in batch logon configurations, such as scheduled tasks or when using the RUNAS command.     Security identifiers (SIDs) were filtered and not allowed to log on.",
