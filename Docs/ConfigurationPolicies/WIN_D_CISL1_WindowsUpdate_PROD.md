### Allow Auto Update

**Description:** Enables the IT admin to manage automatic update behavior to scan, download, and install updates. Supported operations are Get and Replace. Important. This option should be used only for systems under regulatory compliance, as you will not get security updates as well. If the policy is not configured, end-users get the default behavior (Auto install and restart).
